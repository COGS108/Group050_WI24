    "As we are approaching graduation, many of us undergraduate students are concerned about finding a job after we graduate. Many students worry if the skills and experiences gained in college will be enough to find a job in their desired field. In addition to that, people without a technical degree wonder if it’s possible to learn the required skills through means other than college. According to a blog by Rice University <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1), both technical and non-technical skills are crucial for data scientists in the modern world. For technical skills the most popular listed on there are advanced math (calculus, linear algebra), programming and machine learning. This begs the question: is it possible to learn those skills independently through online platforms in order to land a job in the field?. \n",

With the huge rise of MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) over the past few years, it might be possible to learn the necessary skills online in order to get the desired job in the field. MOOCs have the potential to be as effective as classroom learning, according to a meta-analysis of effectiveness of online education <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3), but best results come from blending classroom education with MOOCs. Generally MOOCs are effective for learners because they allow them to access a massive amount of new skills and often are free or much cheaper than college classes are. The rise of MOOCs since 2012 has created a new interesting avenue for acquiring education and work-force skills and needs to be further researched on how the quality of knowledge compares to more traditional methods. Nonetheless, having those resources might be helpful when looking to apply for jobs, especially in technical fields like data science. In this project we will explore how accessible relevant courses are by looking at how many Coursera data science courses align with current data science job market skills demands.",

This minimizes issues of personal privacy to a minimum. However, even a data set without people’s information can have pre-existing biases. For example, most MOOCs users, including on Coursera, are from the United States. This means that we should narrow down our job postings dataset only to the United States, in order to keep the data aligned with each other. We acknowledge that this creates a bias for data science job posting for a single country, which is not representative of the whole world.",

When writing and finalizing our analysis we will discuss how biases of the dataset might have skewed our results and conclusions."

For example, if you have selected a problem that involves implementing multiple neural networks, please state this so we can make sure you know what you’re doing and so we can point you to resources you will need to implement your project.
